Build a mobile-first React app called Morrow — an AI-powered personal finance and savings coach.

The visual style should be warm, friendly, and inspired by Cleo:

Soft beige backgrounds (#F5F0EB)

Deep brown text (#3C2220)

Warm orange accents (#FFB65C)

Full-bleed hero images on onboarding

Rounded cards, large typography, playful microcopy

iPhone-friendly (390×844)

The app should support:

Full onboarding flow with cover images

Bank connection (Plaid placeholder)

Goal-based vaults with soft lock

A full Smart Savings “Savings Lab” with multiple savings methods

AI Coach chat

Rewards & prize-linked savings

Use clean, modular component structure so we can wire real APIs later.
